## 🚀 Project Story

### 📌 Inspiration

Real estate has always been a symbol of stability and long-term wealth. But for most people, especially the younger crowd, it's a distant dream — too expensive, too complicated.

The spark came from how fintech is transforming everything — from stocks to crypto — with fractional ownership and collaborative investing. So I thought, why not bring the same innovation to real estate?

This app helps people co-own premium real estate properties in small, affordable fractions — making property investment simple, modern, and accessible to all.

## ⚠️ Challenges Faced
